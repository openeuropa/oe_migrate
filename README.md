# OpenEuropa Migration

The OpenEuropa Migration provides extensions to the core migration framework, to migrate data from Drupal 7 to the OpenEuropa project.

### Process plugins

* **ApplyFilters (oe_migration_apply_filters)** : Applies filters of the given filter format to a string.
* **Pipeline (oe_migration_pipeline)** : Executes a group of process plugins, stored in a `oe_migration_process_pipeline` configuration entity.


### Sub-modules

* #### OpenEuropa Workflow
  * **[Process plugin] SetWorkflowState (oe_migration_set_workflow_state)** : Sets the workflow state of an entity.

    **Dependencies:** [Workflows](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/workflows)

## Development setup

You can build the development site by running the following steps:

* Install the Composer dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

A post command hook (`drupal:site-setup`) is triggered automatically after `composer install`.
It will make sure that the necessary symlinks are properly setup in the development site.
It will also perform token substitution in development configuration files such as `behat.yml.dist`.

* Install test site by running:

```bash
./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-install
```

The development site web root should be available in the `build` directory.

### Using Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can build a development site using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) with the provided configuration.

Docker provides the necessary services and tools such as a web server and a database server to get the site running,
regardless of your local host configuration.

#### Requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

#### Configuration

By default, Docker Compose reads two files, a `docker-compose.yml` and an optional `docker-compose.override.yml` file.
By convention, the `docker-compose.yml` contains your base configuration and it's provided by default.
The override file, as its name implies, can contain configuration overrides for existing services or entirely new
services.
If a service is defined in both files, Docker Compose merges the configurations.

Find more information on Docker Compose extension mechanism on [the official Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/).

#### Usage

To start, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

It's advised to not daemonize `docker-compose` so you can turn it off (`CTRL+C`) quickly when you're done working.
However, if you'd like to daemonize it, you have to add the flag `-d`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then:

```bash
docker-compose exec web composer install
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-install
```

Using default configuration, the development site files should be available in the `build` directory and the development site
should be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/build](http://127.0.0.1:8080/build).

##### How to use the Pipelines plugin
The process plugin Pipeline executes a process pipeline loaded from configuration.

This configuration entity can be created in the database of different ways, provided by the Drupal Core modules:
- Using the command `drush config:import` with the `--partial` option (`drush config:import --partial --source/path/to/the/folder/`).
- Using the UI provided by the module Configuration Manager to import single files (or going directly to the path `/admin/config/development/configuration/single/import_en`)
- Setting a correct yaml file into a /config/install directory inside a custom module.

This is an example of a `oe_migration.oe_migration_process_pipeline` config entity in a yaml format, ready to be imported:

```
  id: my_process_pipeline
  label: 'My process pipeline'
  description: 'Process pipeline for processing fulltext fields'
  process:
    -
      plugin: dom
      method: import
    -
      plugin: dom_str_replace
      mode: attribute
      xpath: '//a'
      attribute_options:
        name: href
      search: 'foo'
      replace: 'bar'
    -
      plugin: dom_str_replace
      mode: attribute
      xpath: '//a'
      attribute_options:
        name: href
      regex: true
      search: '/foo/'
      replace: TOKEN1
    -
      plugin: dom
      method: export
```

#### Running the tests

To run the grumphp checks:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/grumphp run
```

To run the phpunit tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

To run the behat tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/behat
```

#### Step debugging

To enable step debugging from the command line, pass the `XDEBUG_SESSION` environment variable with any value to
the container:

```bash
docker-compose exec -e XDEBUG_SESSION=1 web <your command>
```

Please note that, starting from XDebug 3, a connection error message will be outputted in the console if the variable is
set but your client is not listening for debugging connections. The error message will cause false negatives for PHPUnit
tests.

To initiate step debugging from the browser, set the correct cookie using a browser extension or a bookmarklet
like the ones generated at https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/marklets/.
